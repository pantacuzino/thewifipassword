        <p>This WiFi key was shared with me via paper: <img src="images/paper-wifi-password.jpg" alt="A piece of paper with the Wi-Fi password shared by the restaurant owner" class="u-full-width"></p>
        <p>I proceeded to write it in the connection box:</p>
        <p>As it happens to most of us, I missed one letter:</p>
        <p>I then had to write it in Notes in order to correct it, one letter at a time, instead of writing it again, 20 characters:</p>
        <p>HNKNNKNJM197511872GH</p>
        <p>It worked, I was connected to the network in under 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>My friend wants to connect and he has misspelled it once as well. He asks whether I'm connected and I confirm. As I have unlocked the great key of the Internet, he continues to ask:
        <span>[insert stan avatar] Can you copy/paste it?</span>
        <span>[insert bran avatar] No, you are not connected to the Internet.</span>
        <span>[insert stan avatar] Well, it's that a J or a 5?</span>
        <span>[insert bran avatar] It's a J.</span>
        And they surfed the Internet happily ever after.</p>

        <p>I start writing the password in a note while reading it from the picture. At the same time I'm spelling it for my friend.</p>
        <p>
          <span>[insert bran avatar] Capital M, capital N</span>
          <span>[insert stan avatar] Wait, capital N?</span>
          <span>[insert bran avatar] Yes</span>

          <span>[insert stan avatar] At the beginning is MNM?</span>

        <p>When you first move to a different place, you snap a picture of the randomly generated password</p>
